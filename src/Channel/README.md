> **Note:** This repository is a part of [Kraken Framework][3], but **can be used freely as standalone library**. If you 
are interested in more asynchronous components for PHP, check out the rest of [Kraken repository][5] or see our 
[asynchronous application skeleton][4] example.

## Description

Channel is an event-based component that allows sending and receiving messsages asynchronously. It provides 
abstraction for various IPC models and is designed to be used in multi-threaded, multi-processed systems. It
provides complex routing mechanisms, protocols, message encoders and extends behaviour of decorated IPC models by 
implementing hearbeat mechanisms, reconnect mechanisms and allowing usage of both async and request-reply messaging 
patterns.

## Feature Highlights

Channel features:

* Message-driven communication,
* IPC models abstraction,
* Support for sending asynchronous messages,
* Support for request-reply pattern,
* Built-in offline and online message buffers,
* Built-in configurable protocol-based routing mechanisms,
* Separation of input and output routers,
* Heartbeat mechanism,
* Reconnect mechanism,
* Event-based API,
* Promise-based helpers,
* Kraken Framework compatibility,
* ...and more.
